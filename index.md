## About Me

I am a theoretical ecologist interested in understanding complex ecological systems. Broadly my work aims to understand how system-level properties such as communiy functioing and stability emerge from interactions of popualtions with each other and their environment. My work uses a range of approaches including mathematical models, computational simulations and empirical data analysis.
